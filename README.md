A mod for Rimworld.

Changes gravship launches to require a startup period before you can launch. After startup, you have a small window to perform the launch, after which you will have to trigger the startup process again.

With this startup, launching a gravship is no longer a consequence-free eject button.

You can begin the Startup phase by selecting the grav engine and clicking the "Initiate GravLaunch Warm-up Sequence" gizmo. By default, the startup phase takes 12 hours, and the following launch window is 6 hours. Both values can be changed in the settings.

Compatible with Vanilla Gravships Expanded. GravJumpers default to a 6 hour startup phase and 3 hour launch window, while GravHulks default to a 24 hour startup phase and a 12 hour launch window. All of these values can be changed in the settings.
